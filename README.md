# Program Guide
A very basic web application to track television shows.

## Background
This is a very simple web application I originally developed to learn the basics of web development with Java Servlets, JSPs, and JSTL. I used this to track television shows I was watching waaaay back in 2005. There are a plethora of applications available now that do this better. The code was originally hosted in CVS, but at some point was converted to Subversion using cvs2svn, and here recently to Git using reposurgeon. The branch and tag convention was based on FreeBSD's release engineering process, but doesn't seem as useful with Git.

## Build
1. `cd program_guide/src`
1. `ant dist`
